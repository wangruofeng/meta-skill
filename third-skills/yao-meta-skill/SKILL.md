# Yao Meta Skill

## Router Rules

- Route by frontmatter `description`.
- Keep `SKILL.md` lean; put guidance in `references/`, logic in `scripts/`, and evidence in `reports/`.
- Use the lightest reliable process.

## Modes

- `Scaffold`: exploratory or personal.
- `Production`: team reuse.
- `Library`: shared infrastructure.

Mode rules: [Method](references/skill-engineering-method.md), [Operating Modes](references/operating-modes.md), [Resource Boundaries](references/resource-boundaries.md).

## Compact Workflow

1. Decide whether the request should become a skill and choose the lightest fit.
2. Capture job, output, exclusions, constraints, and standards.
3. Run reference scan: external benchmarks first, user references second, local fit third; surface only uncertainty or conflict.
4. Write the `description` early and test route quality before expanding the package.
5. Add output-risk, artifact-design, prompt-quality, and system-model reports only when they matter.
6. Add only folders and gates that earn their keep.
7. Surface the top three next iteration directions.

Core playbooks: [Method](references/skill-engineering-method.md), [Intent Dialogue](references/intent-dialogue.md), [Reference Scan](references/reference-scan.md), [Artifact Design](references/artifact-design-doctrine.md), [Prompt Engineering](references/prompt-engineering-doctrine.md), [Systems Thinking](references/systems-thinking-doctrine.md).

## First-Turn Style

When the skill first activates:

- open warmly, like a thoughtful teacher or design partner
- start from the user's work and desired outcome before asking for structure
- ask only `2-3` key questions unless the user already gave enough detail
- let the user answer naturally first; offer a tiny scaffold only as a shortcut
- avoid cold field lists; turn benchmark work into one recommendation unless uncertainty or conflict needs a visible call

Chinese conversations should sound soft and companion-like rather than procedural.

Opening patterns: [Intent Dialogue](references/intent-dialogue.md).

## Output Contract

Unless the user asks otherwise, produce:

1. a working skill directory
2. a `SKILL.md`
3. aligned `agents/interface.yaml`
4. optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `evals/`, `reports/`, and `manifest.json` when justified
5. a short summary of boundary, exclusions, gates, and next steps
